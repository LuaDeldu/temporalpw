# [Temporal.pw]

[Temporal.pw] provides temporary secure storage for passwords so you can safely transmit them over insecure channels like E-Mail, Instant Messaging, SMS, etc.
  - Passwords are encrypted on the client side, the AES decryption key is never sent to the server.
  - Passwords are only ever viewable a single time, so you can be sure that nobody else intercepted it.
  - You can optionally restrict unique temporary password URLs so that they're only accessible from your same IP address (useful for sending passwords securely to someone in the same network).
