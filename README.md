# [Temporal.PW]

[Temporal.PW] provides temporary secure storage for passwords so you can safely transmit them over insecure channels like E-Mail, Instant Messaging, SMS, etc.
  - All encryption / decryption is done in the client browser, the AES key is never sent to the server.
  - Passwords are only ever viewable a single time, so you can be certain that only one recipient viewed it.
  - You can choose to restrict unique temporary password URLs so that they're only accessible from your same IP address (useful for sending passwords securely to someone in the same network).
